# Uniswap v3 on zkSync

ðŸš§ work in progress ðŸš§

This repo contains the script to submit the governance proposal to deploy Uniswap v3 on zkSync.

The script has been created following the [governance documentation](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/guides/governance/liscense-modifications/) and includes a license modification to allow Matter Labs to deploy Uniswap.

## Proposal information

Proposal information can be found at the end of the `utils.ts` file.

## Prerequisites

This project requires Node.js and NPM. [Installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

Install all dependencies with `npm i`

## Testing

The `test/simulate-proposal-process.ts` file simulates the whole lifecycle of the proposal, from sending it, voting, queue and execution.

Before running the test, rename `.env.example` to `.env` and enter following params:

- `SIGNER` wallet address that will send the proposal. Must have 2.5Mill UNI.

> **Important**: this test runs against an Ethereum mainnet fork from block 15647465. You can change this block in the `hardhat.confg.ts` file.

Once configured, run `npx hardhat test`, to run the whole lifecycle script. You'll see the progress in the terminal and, if everything goes write you'll see something like this:

```
....
Proposal executed? :>>  true
âœ… All good.
License in ENS now contains text:
```

## Run script

**To actually send a proposal, you need a wallet with 2.5 million UNI tokens**

Before running the script to send the proposal, rename `.env.example` to `.env` and enter following params:

- `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY` wallet **private key** that will sign the transaction to send the proposal. Must have 2.5Mill UNI.
- `MAINNET_RPC`: and RPC enpoint of the Ethereum mainnet. You can get one from Chainstack/Alchemy/Infura

To execute the proposal script, run `npm start`. This will execute the script using **ts-node** via `npx` so it'll require you to be online.

You'll see the progress in the console with a transaction id that you can search in [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)
