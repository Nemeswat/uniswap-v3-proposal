# Uniswap v3 on zkSync

ðŸš§ work in progress ðŸš§

This repo contains the script to submit the governance proposal to deploy Uniswap v3 on zkSync.

The script has been created following the [governance documentation](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/guides/governance/liscense-modifications/) and includes a license modification to allow Matter Labs to deploy Uniswap.

## Prerequisites

This project requires Node.js and NPM. [Installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Configuration

You'd need to configure an RPC endpoint and the wallet address that will submit the proposal. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and enter the details in the file.

## Testing

To simulate the full lifecycle of the proposal, configure the following parameters in the `.env` file:

- `MAINNET_RPC` with and endpoint from Infura/Alchemy/Chainstack.
- `PROVIDER_RPC_URL` set as `http://127.0.0.1:8545`
- `SIGNER` wallet address that will send the proposal. Must have 2.5Mill UNI.
- `VOTER` wallet address of a voter. Must have UNI tokens

Once configured, run `npx hardhat node`, which will fork mainnet from the block number indicated in the `hardhat.config.ts` file, and start a local node running on `127.0.0.1:8545`.

In a separate terminal, run `npm run test` to run the `simulate-proposal-process.ts` test script. You'll see the progress in the terminal.

## Run script

To execute the proposal script, run `npm start`. This will execute the script using **ts-node** via `npx` so it'll require you to be online.
