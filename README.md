# Uniswap v3 on zkSync

ðŸš§ work in progress ðŸš§

This repo contains the script to submit the governance proposal to deploy Uniswap v3 on zkSync.

The script has been created following the [governance documentation](https://docs.uniswap.org/protocol/guides/governance/liscense-modifications/) and includes a license modification to allow Matter Labs to deploy Uniswap.

## Prerequisites

This project requires Node.js and NPM. [Installation guide](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

## Configuration

You'd need to configure an RPC endpoint and the wallet address that will submit the proposal. Rename `.env.example` to `.env` and enter the details in the file.

## Run script

To execute the proposal script, run `npm start`. This will execute the script using **ts-node** via `npx` so it'll require you to be online.
